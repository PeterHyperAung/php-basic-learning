- PHP has all togther 16 error types.
- 7 of them are essential.
- E_PARSE -> the code wasn't even executed due to syntax error
- E_ERROR -> Fatal error -> which stops the entire program
- E_WARNING -> Program keeps working but something huge is wrong
- E_NOTICE -> When there is a possible error
- E_STRICT -> This happen when u use bad practice code while using strict mode (like you hint the type for function parameters; u give the wrong type; PHP converts it and uses it)
- strict mode activation -> declare(strict_types=1);
- E_DEPRECATED -> Deprecated Error occur when u use the feature that u shouldn't use or the old feature that is no longer supported
- E_ALL -> All types of errors
- this setting is in php.ini
- error configuration in the file -> function -> error_reporting();
- error_reporting(0); -> show no error
- error_reporting(E_ALL) or error_reporting(-1) -> show all errors
- error_reporting(E_PARSE || E_ERROR || E_WARNING) -> only parse error, fatal error and warning
- error_reporting(E_ALL  & ~E_NOTICE); -> all errors except notice
